# ACNE v1.1.1 - Git Ownership Fix Release

## 🔧 Fix Summary
**Issue:** Git ownership error preventing self-commits:
```
fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/app'
```

**Solution:** Enhanced Git configuration with multiple ownership fixes:
1. **Startup initialization** - Git config runs immediately when container starts
2. **Multiple directory coverage** - Fixes `/app`, `/tmp`, `.`, `*` ownership
3. **Enhanced error handling** - More robust Git operations
4. **Proactive configuration** - Sets up Git before any operations

## 📁 Files Modified

- ✅ `app.py` - Added startup Git configuration initialization 
- ✅ `frontend.html` - Updated version to v1.1.1
